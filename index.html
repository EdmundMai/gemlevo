				<p>What are the subscription options?</p>

				<p>You can purchase month-to-month, 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year.  Plans will auto-renew at the end of their duration. You can cancel at any time. Gemlevo is only available for shipping in the U.S.</p>

				<p>Can I give Gemlevo as a gift?</p>

				<p>Absolutely! Just click on Gift, and you will be given a unique URL to give to your gift recipient. Gift subscriptions are a one-time purchase redeemable as a voucher code.</p>

				<p>How do you process payments?</p>

				<p>We use Amazon to securely process our payments. You'll be directed to Amazon for payment and returned to our site once your order is complete. You'll have the option to create a free Amazon account if you don't already have one.</p>

				<p>How much is shipping?</p>

				<p>We provide free shipping via USPS.</p>

				<p>When can I expect my order to arrive?</p>

				<p>As we make small orders with our partners around the world, orders placed before the 15th of each month usually arrive within 10 to 14 business days. Orders placed after the 15th will begin the following month. </p>

				<p>What if I'm unhappy with one of the items?</p>

				<p>If you are unsatisfied with your Gemlevo piece for any reason, you can ship it back to us within 30 days (unfortunately, we can't pay for return shipping), and we'll gladly exchange it for a new piece.</p>

				<p>Is my personal information safe?</p>

				<p>Payment is handled through Amazon and all member data will never be sold to or shared with third-party marketers.</p>
